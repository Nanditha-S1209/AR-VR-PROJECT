ABSTRACT

The Augmented Reality Interior Planner project aims to revolutionize interior design and space planning by harnessing the power of augmented reality. Its primary objective is to provide users with a user-friendly and intuitive platform to visualize, plan, and optimize interior spaces in real-time. The application will offer real-time suggestions for optimizing spatial layouts and selecting appropriate furnishings to enhance functionality and aesthetics. By leveraging advanced AR technologies, the application will enable users to efficiently select and arrange furniture, decor, and other elements, ensuring effective space utilization. Users can visualize potential designs within their physical environment, enabling informed decision-making and efficient space utilization. Extensive research indicates a growing demand for innovative solutions that simplify the interior design process and improve spatial awareness. Current challenges include difficulty visualizing furniture placement, uncertainty about style compatibility, and the high cost associated with design mistakes. The AR Interior Planner project addresses these issues by offering a dynamic AR environment where users can experiment with various design options, receive real-time feedback, and make informed decisions. DESIGN SOLUTIONS Residential Design Homeowners can use the app to visualize and plan their living spaces, ensuring optimal furniture placement and decor selection. Commercial Design Interior designers and architects can utilize the app to create efficient layouts for offices, retail spaces, and hospitality environments, improving functionality and customer experience. Real Estate Real estate agents can leverage the app to stage properties virtually, helping potential buyers envision themselves in the space and facilitating faster sales. SOFTWARE The AR Interior Planner application will be developed using the Unity Software, a powerful game development platform known for its versatility and ease of use. Unity's robust AR features and extensive library of assets will enable efficient development and deployment of the AR Interior Planner app across multiple platforms, ensuring a seamless user experience. This Documentation of the project expresses the idea about the AR project that includes objective and research findings, and the software tool that will be used to develop this augmented reality application.

INTRODUCTION

The AR Interior Planner project is an innovative venture aimed at revolutionizing the traditional approach to interior design and space planning. With the rapid advancements in augmented reality (AR) technology, there emerges a unique opportunity to merge digital and physical realms seamlessly, offering users an immersive and interactive experience like never before. This project seeks to capitalize on this potential by developing a user-friendly AR application that empowers individuals, designers, and businesses alike to visualize, plan, and optimize interior spaces in real-time. This can be particularly useful for clients who have difficulty visualizing final results, or for architects and designers who want to test different materials, colors, and layouts before making decisions. AR VR can also be useful for remote collaboration, allowing stakeholders to virtually meet in a shared 3D space to discuss and make changes to the design in real-time. Unlike conventional design methods that often rely on two-dimensional representations or static renderings, AR Interior Planner introduces a dynamic and interactive platform where users can virtually explore and manipulate spatial elements within their physical environment. By leveraging AR technology, users can experiment with different furniture layouts, decor options, and spatial configurations, gaining invaluable insights into how these choices will impact the functionality, aesthetics, and overall atmosphere of their spaces.

EXPECTED OUTCOME

Leveraging Augmented Reality technology can significantly improve the visualization of interior design concepts, allowing clients to better understand and appreciate the proposed designs before implementation. And the project aims to increase client satisfaction by ensuring that their expectations are met and their feedback is incorporated effectively. The project will result in a more efficient decision-making process, enabling designers and clients to test different materials, colors, and layouts in real-time, leading to quicker and more informed design choices. And also it will enable seamless remote collaboration, allowing stakeholders to meet in a shared virtual 3D space to discuss and make real-time modifications regardless of their physical location. Cost and Time saving can be achieved by identifying design issues early and enabling quick changes in the virtual environment, the project aims to reduce the need for costly and time-consuming revisions during the actual implementation phase. Overall, expected outcome is to create a more immersive, interactive, and efficient interior design experience that leads to greater client satisfaction, improved design decisions, and streamlined project workflows. This Documentation of the project emphasizes the introduction about the project that conveys the essence of the project and followed by the expected outcome considering the benefits of building this interior design augmented reality application.# AR-VR-Project
